		<p><span class="red">You are using the free version of Lively which has a limit of 2 conversations per day.</span> When your chatbox hits the limit, it will simply remain hidden until the next day.</p>
		<p>To lift this limit <em>and access all of your website's untapped potential</em>, you'll need to activate your chatbox with one of the monthly packages below. All packages include:</p>

		<ul class="risk_list">
			<li>Unlimited Agents</li>
			<li>Unlimited Triggers (smooth Call-To-Actions start conversations automatically)</li>
			<li>Unlimited Canned Messages (respond quickly with prebuilt messages)</li>
			<li>Flexible Introducer Fields (choose what information you want to collect from the visitor &mdash; and when you want it)</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="hint" style="margin-top: -25px; ">
			A conversation is when an agent and visitor reply to each other.

			<strong>Why do I need to choose a plan?</strong><br>
			<em>The truth is: you don't.</em> You could stay limited to 2 conversations per day forever, but you'll be losing out on loads of business. Our paying plans allow us to build new features, mobile apps (coming soon), build Fort-Knox-like security, host your chatbox, and scale to whatever bandwidth your site needs.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<strong>100% Money-Back Guarantee</strong><br>
			You have enough risks to consider &mdash; Lively should not be one of them! We've eliminated <em>all</em> the risks by offering you an Unlimited-Term, Unlimited-Features Trial. The only catch is that you're restricted to <em>2 conversations per day</em>.
		</p>
		
		<p>To top it off, we have a rock solid guarantee: <strong>If Lively doesn't boost your business' bottom line in your 1st month, we'll give you a 100% refund &mdash; no questions asked!</strong>
